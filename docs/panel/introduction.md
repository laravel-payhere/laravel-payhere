# Introduction

Laravel PayHere includes a built-in [Filament panel](https://filamentphp.com) for managing payments and subscriptions in your application. Therefore, you donâ€™t need to develop additional features such as display payments, handle subscriptions, or manage refunds.

The PayHere panel is enabled by default, you can access it at `http://website.test/payhere`.
