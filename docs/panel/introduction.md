# Introduction

> [!WARNING]
> The PayHere Panel is no longer available from v3.0 and will be released as a new package in the near future. If you're still interested in using it, please refer to v2.0 for the implementation.

Laravel PayHere includes a built-in [Filament panel](https://filamentphp.com) for managing payments and subscriptions in your application. Therefore, you donâ€™t need to develop additional features such as display payments, handle subscriptions, or manage refunds.

The PayHere panel is enabled by default, you can access it at `http://website.test/payhere`.
