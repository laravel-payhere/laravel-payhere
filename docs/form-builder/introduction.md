# Introduction

[PayHere](https://payhere.lk) uses HTML form-based APIs to process various types of checkouts, such as recurring checkout, authorize checkout, preapproval checkout, and normal checkout. Therefore, the HTML form-based API builder helps generate the necessary HTML inputs based on your configuration and redirects users to the payment gateway to complete the transaction.
