# PayHere JS

PayHere has its own [Javascript SDK](https://support.payhere.lk/api-&-mobile-sdk/javascript-sdk) to initiate the PayHere onsite checkout. you can load the Javascript SDK by placing the `@payhereJS` Blade directive right before your application layout's closing `</head>` tag:

```html
<head>
    @payhereJS
</head>
```
